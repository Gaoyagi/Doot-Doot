# Doot-Doot bot
## About
A Golang Discod muisc bot that join calls and streams music to everyone in the call.
Inspired by the need to replace Rythm and Groovy bots after their takedown and the need to relearn GoLang 
(I also learned why they were taken down lol)

## Direct Dependencies:
- github.com/bwmarrin/dgvoice
- github.com/spf13/viper

## Prerequisite programs:
- Golang

- GCC

## How to use:
- clone this repo
- create a .env file

## Future plans/current problems:

- needs my bot token to work still
- publish on discord 
- switch the audio stream source from predownloaded audio files to audio live streams
